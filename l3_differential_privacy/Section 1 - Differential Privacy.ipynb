I'm not a policeman, I'm just trying to collect statistics to understand the higher level trend in society. So, how do we do this? One technique is to add randomness to each person's response by giving each person the following instructions (assuming I'm asking a simple yes/no question):\n",

If they answer \"Yes\" to the question \"have you committed X crime?\", then it might becasue they actually did, or it might be becasue they are answering according to a random coin flip. Each person has a high degree of protection. Furthermore, we can recover the underlying statistics with some accuracy, as the \"true statistics\" are simply averaged with a 50% probability. Thus, if we collect a bunch of samples and it turns out that 60% of people answer yes, then we know that the TRUE distribution is actually centered around 70%, because 70% averaged wtih 50% (a coin flip) is 60% which is the result we obtained. \n",

    "\n",
    "The previous method of adding noise was called \"Local Differentail Privacy\" because we added noise to each datapoint individually. This is necessary for some situations wherein the data is SO sensitive that individuals do not trust noise to be added later. However, it comes at a very high cost in terms of accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, alternatively we can add noise AFTER data has been aggregated by a function. This kind of noise can allow for similar levels of protection with a lower affect on accuracy. However, participants must be able to trust that no-one looked at their datapoints _before_ the aggregation took place. In some situations this works out well, in others (such as an individual hand-surveying a group of people), this is less realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, global differential privacy is incredibly important because it allows us to perform differential privacy on smaller groups of individuals with lower amounts of noise. Let's revisit our sum functions."

    "This definition does not _create_ differential privacy, instead it is a measure of how much privacy is afforded by a query M. Specifically, it's a comparison between running the query M on a database (x) and a parallel database (y). As you remember, parallel databases are defined to be the same as a full database (x) with one entry/person removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this definition says that FOR ALL parallel databases, the maximum distance between a query on database (x) and the same query on database (y) will be e^epsilon, but that occasionally this constraint won't hold with probability delta. Thus, this theorem is called \"epsilon delta\" differential privacy.\n",

    "# Epsilon\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack the intuition of this for a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Epsilon Zero: If a query satisfied this inequality where epsilon was set to 0, then that would mean that the query for all parallel databases outputed the exact same value as the full database. As you may remember, when we calculated the \"threshold\" function, often the Sensitivity was 0. In that case, the epsilon also happened to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epsilon One: If a query satisfied this inequality with epsilon 1, then the maximum distance between all queries would be 1 - or more precisely - the maximum distance between the two random distributions M(x) and M(y) is 1 (because all these queries have some amount of randomness in them, just like we observed in the last section).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delta\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta is basically the probability that epsilon breaks. Namely, sometimes the epsilon is different for some queries than it is for others. For example, you may remember when we were calculating the sensitivity of threshold, most of the time sensitivity was 0 but sometimes it was 1. Thus, we could calculate this as \"epsilon zero but non-zero delta\" which would say that epsilon is perfect except for some probability of the time when it's arbitrarily higher. Note that this expression doesn't represent the full tradeoff between epsilon and delta."

    "# Lesson: How To Add Noise for Global Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we're going to learn about how to take a query and add varying amounts of noise so that it satisfies a certain degree of differential privacy. In particular, we're going to leave behind the Local Differential privacy previously discussed and instead opt to focus on Global differential privacy. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to sum up, this lesson is about adding noise to the output of our query so that it satisfies a certain epsilon-delta differential privacy threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of noise we can add - Gaussian Noise or Laplacian Noise. Generally speaking Laplacian is better, but both are still valid. Now to the hard question...\n",
    "\n",
    "### How much noise should we add?\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of noise necessary to add to the output of a query is a function of four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the type of noise (Gaussian/Laplacian)\n",
    "- the sensitivity of the query/function\n",
    "- the desired epsilon (ε)\n",
    "- the desired delta (δ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for each type of noise we're adding, we have different way of calculating how much to add as a function of sensitivity, epsilon, and delta. We're going to focus on Laplacian noise. Laplacian noise is increased/decreased according to a \"scale\" parameter b. We choose \"b\" based on the following formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "b = sensitivity(query) / epsilon\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we set b to be this value, then we know that we will have a privacy leakage of <= epsilon. Furthermore, the nice thing about Laplace is that it guarantees this with delta == 0. There are some tunings where we can have very low epsilon where delta is non-zero, but we'll ignore them for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying Repeatedly\n",
    "\n",
    "- if we query the database multiple times - we can simply add the epsilons (Even if we change the amount of noise and their epsilons are not the same)."

    "# Lesson: Differential Privacy for Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the last lessons you may have been wondering - what does all of this have to do with Deep Learning? Well, these same techniques we were just studying form the core primitives for how Differential Privacy provides guarantees in the context of Deep Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we defined perfect privacy as \"a query to a database returns the same value even if we remove any person from the database\", and used this intuition in the description of epsilon/delta. In the context of deep learning we have a similar standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a model on a dataset should return the same model even if we remove any person from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we've replaced \"querying a database\" with \"training a model on a dataset\". In essence, the training process is a kind of query. However, one should note that this adds two points of complexity which database queries did not have:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. do we always know where \"people\" are referenced in the dataset?\n",
    "    2. neural models rarely never train to the same output model, even on identical data\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to (1) is to treat each training example as a single, separate person. Strictly speaking, this is often overly zealous as some training examples have no relevance to people and others may have multiple/partial (consider an image with multiple people contained within it). Thus, localizing exactly where \"people\" are referenced, and thus how much your model would change if people were removed, is challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to (2) is also an open problem - but several interesitng proposals have been made. We're going to focus on one of the most popular proposals, PATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example Scenario: A Health Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "First we're going to consider a scenario - you work for a hospital and you have a large collection of images about your patients. However, you don't know what's in them. You would like to use these images to develop a neural network which can automatically classify them, however since your images aren't labeled, they aren't sufficient to train a classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, being a cunning strategist, you realize that you can reach out to 10 partner hospitals which DO have annotated data. It is your hope to train your new classifier on their datasets so that you can automatically label your own. While these hospitals are interested in helping, they have privacy concerns regarding information about their patients. Thus, you will use the following technique to train a classifier which protects the privacy of patients in the other hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) You'll ask each of the 10 hospitals to train a model on their own datasets (All of which have the same kinds of labels)\n",
    "- 2) You'll then use each of the 10 partner models to predict on your local dataset, generating 10 labels for each of your datapoints\n",
    "- 3) Then, for each local data point (now with 10 labels), you will perform a DP query to generate the final true label. This query is a \"max\" function, where \"max\" is the most frequent label across the 10 labels. We will need to add laplacian noise to make this Differentially Private to a certain epsilon/delta constraint.\n",
    "- 4) Finally, we will retrain a new model on our local dataset which now has labels. This will be our final \"DP\" model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's walk through these steps. I will assume you're already familiar with how to train/predict a deep neural network, so we'll skip steps 1 and 2 and work with example data. We'll focus instead on step 3, namely how to perform the DP query for each example using toy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's say we have 10,000 training examples, and we've got 10 labels for each example (from our 10 \"teacher models\" which were trained directly on private data). Each label is chosen from a set of 10 possible labels (categories) for each image."
